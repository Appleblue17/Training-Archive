## F. Random Segment Tree

### 题目描述

Define a random segment tree as a binary tree where each node represents
a closed interval $[l, r]$:
- If $l = r$, then the node is a leaf node.
- If $l < r$ and the length of the interval $(r-l+1)$ is even: let $x = \left\lfloor \frac{l+r}{2} \right\rfloor$. The left child of the node represents $[l, x]$, and the right child represents $[x+1, r]$.
- If $l < r$ and the length of the interval $(r-l+1)$ is odd: let $x = \frac{l+r}{2}$. With a probability of $1/2$, the left child represents $[l, x]$ and the right child represents $[x+1, r]$; with a probability of $1/2$, the left child represents $[l, x-1]$ and the right child represents $[x, r]$.

Given a segment tree, define $\mathrm{cost}(x, y)$ as follows:

When querying the interval $[x, y]$, starting from the root node, suppose the current node is $[l, r]$, the process is as follows:

If $[x, y]$ contains $[l, r]$, the query ends.
Otherwise, if the left child node intersects with $[x, y]$, query the left child node; if the right child node intersects with $[x, y]$, query the right child node.
The value of $\mathrm{cost}(x, y)$ is the number of nodes visited during the query process.

Given $n$, consider a random segment tree whose root node represents $[1, n]$. For $1 \leq i \leq 2n$, compute the expected number of intervals $[x, y]$ where $\mathrm{cost}(x, y)$ equals $i$, with the result modulo $998244353$.

### 输入描述
